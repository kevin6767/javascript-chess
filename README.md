# What I want to do

I want to create a chessboard application that allows you to play against a very primitive computer. I want to build a board completely from scratch and build the chess engine from scratch as well. Formulating my own functions to handle each movement and capturing event that happens during the game.

- [x] Create a function that generate the board
- [x] Create css rules for alternating the cells colors
- [x] Create event listener to build a click and drop system
- [x] position the pieces at the beginning of the game
- [ ] create movement functions
- [ ] handle capturing and check'ing
- [ ] handle winning/losing
- [ ] build primitive AI
- [x] organize and clean code
